Shoot-Em Up Style Game using images/gifs/audio in a unique random projected world

Began as a simple test coding session to replace an image with another image on click, and to use random code to make it more interesting.

Started adding to this code over and over addictively..to challenge media coding ideas to how to make things feel like a video game.

Still working on this - read console/comments in code

Few bugs

Coding Progress Comments need updates too

There are hidden features, and scoring

There is leftover test code in comments to see what the code is doing at certain points.


This is some of the most fun code I have ever put together, and sort of represents some of my abstract coding abilites, and understanding of how it all works together.


Have fun
